WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity and Access Management solution federating and managing identities across both enterprise and cloud service environments. It supports a wide array of authentication protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive. It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound provisioning is supported through SCIM.
This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.
