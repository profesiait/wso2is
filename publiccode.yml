      # WSO2 Identity Server


      WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity and Access  Management
      solution that helps federating and managing identities  across both
      enterprise and cloud service environments. It supports a  wide array of
      authentication protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID,  OAuth 2.0,
      OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive. It supports role  based
      authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0  and Open
      Agent, while inbound/outbound provisioning is supported through  SCIM.
